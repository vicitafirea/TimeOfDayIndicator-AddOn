# TimeOfDayIndicator-Addon
Addon designed to work as a replacement of the default World of Warcraft Vanilla UI's GameTimeFrame.

Last update was made in 27-07-2023, and around then I stopped playing Turtle WoW due to family issues and mental problems.

Used and was mostly functional in Turtle WoW, but it requires additional refining and it's just for fun in any spice of the game.

It's a glorified in-game analog clock, and can barely tell the time visually, due to the fact that it's deceptive by design (since the Day-Night Cycle works different inside World of Warcraft compared to real life).
